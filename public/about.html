            SCALEFARM?</div>
        <div class="what_is_answer" style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">SCALEFARM is a new
            social action initiative project. It created in June 15, 2023.
            SCALEFARM targets crucial environmental problems that world faces such as huge amounts of household
            sustainable waste, use of soil with pesticides, and dehydrated land.</div>

        <div class="how_we_solve_question"
            style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-size: 1.3rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1rem;">How we solve
            problems?</div>
        <div class="how_we_solve_answer" style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">SCALEFARM has
            a unique approach to environmental issues. That is, saving
            environment without even $1 by using household materials. There are two ways: composting from household
            sustainable materials and vertical farming. You will find information in our Actions page.</div>

            founder writes</div>
        <div class="founder_1_para" style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">Hello everybody! I
            am Nikolaos Nikolov and I am 16 years old. I founded my first
            initiative project because I wanted to solve problems near me. We all hear in the news about climate change
            and its effects. We live it! But we cannot stay idle! We have to save our future! In one word: SCALEFARM.
        </div>
        <div class="founder_2_para" style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">We have a plan
            which is tested first of all in my home and it works. Composting our
            household sustainable materials is very simple and quick! While recycling average in EU is 27%, in Greece,
            where I live, it’s only 15%. Composting will happen easily, with a plastic bucket and your household waste.
            That’s it!</div>
        <div class="founder_3_para" style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">The soil that will
            be created has manure features. Now, vertical farming is needed.
            Think of a small vertical grocery in your balcony that will provide you high quantities of fresh fruits and
            vegetables. You will like it!</div>
        <div class="founder_4_para" style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">You can follow us!
            Stay tuned and if you are interested to join our team, send us an
            email! We are sure that we can save our future. We can save our environment. We just have to change habits
            in our homes!</div>
